# Spatial-Analytics-Assignment-5

Here is the code for my submission for Spatial Analytics assignment 5:

For a nice and smooth depiction of my code see the .md-file in this repository ("Assignment-5.md")

If you wish to run the code yourself you should download the .Rmd-file in this repository. This can be done manually by going through the following steps:

1: Open the "Assignment 5.Rmd"-file in this repository.

2: Press "Raw" in the top right corner

3: Save the file as an .Rmd-file (windows: ctrl + s // mac: cmd + s)

4: Place the file in the folder where the data-folder is stored (i.e. not in the data-folder but in the same place as the data-folder!).
